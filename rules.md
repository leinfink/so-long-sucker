# Rules of the Game

1) Every player starts with a stock of their own chips (with their own color, which "indicates" the player) and may during the course of the game collect other people's chips as "prisoners".
2) A randomly chosen player is given the first move.
3) A move consists in playing a chip from your possession (either your own color or a prisoner) onto the playing area, either on top of an old pile or by creating a new pile.
4) After playing a chip onto a pile, the next player is determined as follows:

    1) If not all colors are represented in the pile, the current player freely chooses one of the players whose color is not yet in the pile and gives them the move. (This may include themselves, if they had just played a prisoner.)
    2) If all colors are represented in the pile, the move is given to the player whose most recently played chip (by color) is the furthest down in the pile. (It doesn't matter who actually played the chip, only the color.)
    3) **EXCEPTION**: If the played chip was of the same color as the one before it in the pile, then the player indicated by this color *captures* the pile: They discard one of the chips in the pile (they get put into the *dead box* and are out of the game), no matter the color, and take in the rest. The chips with foreign colors are now their *prisoners*. They then get the next move.

5) A player may at any point during the game transfer a prisoner to another player.
6) A player may at any point during the game kill a prisoner by putting it into the *dead box*.
7) If a player is given the move, but doesn't have any chips of their own color nor any prisoners, all remaining players get asked to help them by transferring a prisoner. If the player is transferred a chip, they play it and the game continues as usual. If everbody refuses to transfer, the player dies and is out of the game. The move is then given to the player who gave them the move. If that player also dies, the move is given to the player who had originally given them the move, etc.
8) Chips with the color of a dead player remain in the game but are ignored when deciding who gets the move. If a pile is captured using that color, it is discarded completely (all the chips go into the *dead box*) and the move goes back to the last player who had it.
9) The last player alive wins, even if they dont have any chips left.
10) Players may at any point during the game give promises, enter into contracts, negotiate treaties and coalitions etc. in the game's public chat (private conversations are not allowed). However, no such agreement is enforced by the rules and a player may break them at any point.
